#1)

If the arrival time is A, the A/60 is Unif(0,1)

So if X, Y are Unif(0,1),

we are asked

$$
  P(|Y-X|<1/4)
$$
this corresponds to the region:

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x<-seq(0,1,0.01)
plot(1, type="n", xlab="", ylab="",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1), xaxs = "i",yaxs = "i")
polygon(c(0,0,0.75,1,1,0.25),c(0,0.25,1,1,0.75,0), col='skyblue')

```
so, 1-(3/4)^2=7/16


#2-a) 

1/3

#2-b)

Carl is the first to arrive at 10min mark.

Carl waits more than 10 minutes for anyone to show up if none show up btw 10 and 20 min mark,ie both show up at 20-30, ie. (1/2)^2=1/4

#2-c)

Carl waits more than 10 minutes for both to show up if there is someone arrives btw 20-30, ie. its not the case that both arrive at 10-20, ie. 1-(1/2)^2=3/4

#2-d)

2nd and 3rd arrive at A, B. These are btw 10-30

we are asked P(|A-B|>5)

Let X=A/20, Y=B/20 so that X,Y ~ Unif(0,1)

So P(|A-B|>5)=P(|X-Y|>1/4)

This is the exercise 1 in reverse so 1-7/16=9/16
